# Travel Buddy

Travel Buddy provides tools to users that are traveling to foreign countries.

Current weather conditions (AccuWeather API) are displayed after detecting the user's
latitude and longitude via the Geolocation API. There is also a language translation
tool users can use which consumes API endpoints provided by MyMemory (language translation).

Live deployment (Firebase): [https://travel-buddy-61fbf.web.app](https://travel-buddy-61fbf.web.app)

For a quick overview of the system, see the 'docs' directory in the project root which holds
the HTML documentation generated by JSDoc.
